## Introduction

In the course so far, we have seen that most computation in C++ is built up of
primitive datatypes like `int`, `float`, `double`, and `bool`. It is safe to say
that these types lie at the foundation of the definition of data, and of course
we cannot have useful computations without data. However, the power of types
does not end there. In fact, there is an entire field of computer science called
type theory which studies the power of types in computer programs. The
expressive power of types is truly extraordinary, although C++ only allows us a
small taste of it. Nevertheless, combining types into new types is still a key
part of C++, and you will need to master it in order to write code that is
performant and, perhaps more importantly, maintainable.

## Motivation

Let us start by reviewing an extraordinarily simple function, the function which
takes as its input a single integer, and returns the absolute value of that
integer. Since it takes an integer as its input, and returns an integer as its
output, the signature of this function is `int → int`. It can be defined as
follows in the C++ programming language:

~~~
int abs(int i) {
  return i >= 0 ? i : -i;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

This function is perfectly sensible, and aside from the fact that there is a
well-tested `std::abs` method in the standard library, there is nothing wrong
with it. Let us now write a function with two integer arguments, representing a
position in a two-dimensional space, which calculates the Manhattan distance to
that point. The type of this function is `(int, int) → int`:

~~~
int manhattan(int x, int y) {
  return std::abs(x) + std::abs(y);
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Once again, there is nothing really wrong with this function. You would find
code written like this in many production code-bases, but it does serve to
motivate the use of compound types. At the risk of seeming pedantic, we can
identify two distinct problems with this code. Firstly, this method of designing
methods risks exploding the number of arguments, which makes it harder to use
the function (because the user must do more typing), and it also makes it harder
to reason about the function (because there is more mental load on anyone
reading this code to keep track of all the arguments). Secondly, there is no
semantic information available in this code that indicates that the two
arguments of this function are linked in any way. A coordinate in our space is
only truly meaningful in conjunction with another one: by itself it is nothing
more than an integer. The function shown above relies on the understanding of
the user to provide two separate numbers that meaningfully combine to represent
a coordinate in our space, and the compiler does nothing to stop the user from
making mistakes by loading in non-related quantities:

~~~
int result = manhattan(grams_of_cheese_for_breakfast, number_of_cats_owned);
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

The example above is somewhat contrived, but we find more gripping examples of
the principles described all over high-energy physics code. Consider, for
example, a function that operates on a particle track state, which is described
as an *n*-tuple and an *n×n* covariance vector. Let's assume *n=5* for now:

~~~
double myfun(double x, double y, double eta, double phi, double qop, double[] cov) {
  ...
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Defining such a function is tedious, and using it even more so. If this function
is commonly used, dozens of programmers will have to write out all six arguments
to this function thousands of times, and the large amount of typing these
programmers have to do is sure to attract more bugs. Indeed, someone might
switch around the η and φ arguments, which would be very difficult to debug. The
idea that having more code to write increases the number of bugs that appear in
that code is sometimes referred to the *surface area* of the code which bugs
can latch onto.

In the rest of this episode, we will see that we can group together the
parameters of the functions given into meaningful units which will make the code
easier to understand and easier to use. At the end of the episode, we will
understand how to write equivalent methods that look like this:

~~~
int manhattan(Point p) {
  return std::abs(p.x) + std::abs(p.y);
}

double myfun(TrackState ts) {
  ...
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

## Product types

The simplest, most common, and most useful type of compound data type is the
product type. These types are conveniently the solution to the problems
addressed in the previous paragraph. Recall that we wanted to write our
`manhattan` method to take a single `Point` type instead of two `int` values. To
achieve this, we will define a product type of two `int` values, which we do
using the `struct` keyword in C++:

~~~
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

What this snippet of code achieves, is that it informs the compiler about the
existence of a new type called `Point`, which contains one integer called `x`
and another integer called `y`. Wherever we have an instance of this new type,
we can access the `x` and `y` values contained within to retrieve the
corresponding integers.

We can now start creating instances of our new type, in much the same way as we
create instances of primitive data types, although there is some special syntax
involved. The following code creates a `Point` object representing the
coordinates (5, 7). Note that this is not the only way to initialize and assign
values to data types, but we will return to this topic in the next paragraph.

~~~
Point p = {5, 7};
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Accessing a member of our newly created point is equally simple. We use the
so-called member accessor operator, which is represented by a full stop (`.`) in
C++. For example, if we have our instance `p` defined above, the expression
`p.x` will give us the value of `x` inside that instance, and `p.y` will give us
the value of `y`. We can also insert new values into our instance using the same
syntax in addition to the assignment operator. For example, the following code
will update the `y` value of our instance to `9`:

~~~
p.y = 9;
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

To tie everything together, here is a minimal program which defines a product
type, initializes an instance of it, modifies one of the values, and then prints
the values contained within to the screen. The output of this program should be
`The point is: (5, 9)` (if it is not, please contact your nearest compiler
engineer).

~~~
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main(void) {
    Point p = {5, 7};

    p.y = 9;

    std::cout << "The point is: (" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

As we have seen, defining and using product types is not too difficult! Most of
the syntax is reminiscent of the way we use primitive datatypes, but with some
extra member accessor operators thrown in. Now, let us discuss how we can
initialize values of our compound datatype, and how we can use them to solve the
problems we disucussed earlier.

## Initializing compound types

Creating instances of our compound types is critical to our ability to use them.
Indeed, if we never produce any points, all the code that uses them will sit in
our code base looking pretty while it collects dust since it can never be used.
This paragraph will be somewhat more technical, and you do not necesserily need
to understand it to make good use of product types. However, it will give you a
better understanding of what is happening under the hood, and it will allow you
to reason more effectively about what is happening when the compiler compiles
certain statements and expressions.

So far, we have seen used syntax of the form `Point p = {5, 7};` to initialize
our instances. This is reminiscent of how we might initialize a primitive
datatype with an expression of the form `int a = 5;`. However, there are some
differences. In both cases, these statements are syntactic sugar, and the
compiler will *desugar* them to read the following:

~~~
// Point p = {5, 7};
Point p;
p = {5, 7};

// int a = 5;
int a;
a = 5;
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Here, the *initialization* of our values has been split into an explicit
*declaration* and an *assignment*. But what exactly is the meaning of the
declaration statement `Point p;`? In fact, what is the meaning of `int a;`? It
is here that we first encounter the concept of *constructors*. A constructor is
a recipe for creating an instance of a type, and one of the fundamental
differences between primitive data types and compound data types is that the
former don't have constructors while the latter do. When we write `int a;`, we
instruct the compiler to reserve enough memory for us to store an integer, and
we will be able to use the name `a` later to conveniently reference that memory.
When declaring an integer or any other primitive data type, the compiler does
absolutely nothing to prepare that memory for use - that happens only when we
assign a value to it later.

{: .challenge}

When we declare an instance of a compound data type, however, the compiler will
implicitly add code to prepare that instance for use: the constructor. The
compiler has helpfully created an implicit default constructor for us, saving us
the hassle of writing our own. We will see later how we can influence the
compiler's decision making process when designing default constructors, and we
will also learn how to create our own constructors.

Constructors are usually called using a syntax reminiscent of function calls,
and this will become important later when we create constructors that have
multiple arguments. However, we do not need to provide the usual function call
parentheses for the default constructor (and, in fact, we are not *allowed* to
provide them, as the meaning of this is ambiguous). Here are a few more ways to
declare, initialize, and assign compound data types:

~~~
// Default constructor:
Point a;

// Default constructor with two assignments:
Point b;
b.x = 5;
b.y = 7;

// Default constructor with one assignment:
Point c;
c.y = 7;

// Initialization with empty initializer list:
Point d {};

// Initialization with non-empty initializer list:
Point e {5, 7};

// Initialization with named initializer list:
Point f {.x=5, .y=7};

// Initialization with partial named initializer list:
Point g {.y=7};

// Assignment with initializer list:
Point h;
h = {.x=5, .y=7};
~~~

{: .challenge}

### Default member values

So far, we have relied on the compiler to generate a default constructor for us.
This is very helpful, because it saves us the work of defining one. However, it
also leaves many of the design choices up to the compiler. For example, the
compiler will not try to initialize any of the integer values in our structure.
Luckily, we can exert some control over the default constructor without having
to define the whole thing. The most common way to do this is by specifying
default values for members. Consider the following C++ code:

~~~
struct Point {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
};
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

This code instructs the compiler to initialize the value of `x` to five, and the
value of `y` to ten. The compiler will incorporate our wishes into the default
constructor, and it will implicitly insert code that sets these values anywhere
that we construct a `Point` instance. It is also possible to specify default
values for some members while omitting them for others. For example, the
following complete program will always give a value of ten for the `y`
coordinate, while the `x` will be unitialized, and its value will therefore be
undefined.

~~~
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y = 10;
};

int main(void) {
    Point p;

    std::cout << "The point is: (" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

## Passing around compound types

Now that we know how to define, declare, initialize, and assign our custom
compound data types, we can finally return to our lamentations about passing
structured data to objects. You will be happy to learn that there is nothing
special about compound types when it comes to defining functions that take them
as arguments, or when passing them into those functions. Indeed, with the
knowledge we have already, extending our functions to use compound data types is
trivial:

~~~
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int manhattan(Point p) {
  return std::abs(p.x) + std::abs(p.y);
}

int main(void) {
    Point p = {-11, 17};

    std::cout << "The Manhattan distance is: " << manhattan(p) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Take a moment to appreciate how compound datatypes allow us to write elegant
code. Firstly, all the arguments to the `manhattan` function are now grouped
together into a single sensible unit. Secondly, it is immediately clear to the
user what the meaning is of these values (indeed, the type is named `Point`, and
not `HeightAndWeight`) - we have encoded additional semantic information into
the function signature using our types. Thirdly, the number of arguments to the
function is reduced, giving both the user and the function author less work to
do.

## Product types in the standard library

In C++, product types are well represented by structs and unions. The standard
library also provides some useful implementations, and we will cover two of them
in this section. Note that all these types can accept non-primitive types
without question, so you should feel free to experiment with them using more
complex types.

### `std::pair`

Firstly, the `std::pair` class represents a 2-tuple (or a couple), which is a
product type between two types. In C++, `std::pair<A, B>` is the product type
`A×B`. Using this type saves you the hassle of defining your own custom data
type. Here is a minimal program showcasing the `pair` type:

~~~
#include <utility>
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    std::pair<int, double> v {5, 11.73};
    v.first = 8;
    std::cout << "Integer part: " << v.first << ", double part: " << v.second << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

### `std::tuple`

Secondly, `std::tuple` generalizes the concept of `std::pair` to an arbitrary
number of types. Whereas a pair has exactly two types, a tuple can have however
many you want. Here is a program that does the same thing as above, but with
an integer, a double, a boolean, and a float.

~~~
#include <tuple>
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    std::tuple<int, double, bool, float> v {5, 11.73, true, -5.81};
    std::get<0>(v) = 8;
    std::get<2>(v) = false;
    std::cout << "Integer part: " << std::get<0>(v) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Double  part: " << std::get<1>(v) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Boolean part: " << std::get<2>(v) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Float   part: " << std::get<3>(v) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
~~~
