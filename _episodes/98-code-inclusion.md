This is a full include:

{% include includecpp filename='code/hello.cpp' highlight='cpp' %}

This is a partial include with line numbers

{% include includecpplines filename='code/hello.cpp' start=3 stop=6 %}

You can also include from a string to a string:

{% include includecppmethod filename='code/hello.cpp' startstring='main()' stopstring='}' %}

{% include links.md %}
